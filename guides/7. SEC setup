#NOTE! - debian and ubuntu provide repo install for SEC, but the version is old
#Since SEC is pretty simple to set up, the main benefit would be provided init scripts
#Real complexity with SEC is ruleset management and creation
#Therefore, the setup and init scripts can be done manually with little management overhead

1. Install SEC

wget -O sec.tar.gz http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/simple-evcorr/sec/2.7.6/sec-2.7.6.tar.gz?r=http%3A%2F%2Fsimple-evcorr.sourceforge.net%2F&ts=1407496593&use_mirror=heanet

tar -xzf sec.tar.gz

2. SEC init script

# This script is far from perfect, but shoud do the trick
# I modified it from the one that was provided with debian repo install
# My script makes use of 

vim /etc/init.d/sec
